# How to create react app?

Resource - https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

Example - npx create-react-app my-app -> (my-app, is Project Name, write your own project name)

# How to create custom component?

Resource - https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

Create a new folder - components - for better organizing

Create a new file named as you component. Ex - ExpenseItem.js
Follow the naming convension.

This file need to export and import at base file or where you need to use this component. Ex - import ExpenseItem from "./components/ExpenseItem"

# How to add css to component?

Naming convenstion - css file will be same as component name. Ex - ExpenseItem.css

css file need to import in component. Ex - import "./ExpenseItem.css";

To add class name to component element you have to add className attribute.
Ex - <div className="expense-time">

# How to call dynamic data in react?

Using curly braces {}
Ex -
const expenseAmount = 294.67;
{expenseAmount}

# Passing Data via "props"

Props allows you to make your components reusable and it allows to pass data from component to component.

First, Pass the data through component attribute.

<!-- App.js -->

const expenses = [
{
id: "e1",
title: "Toilet Paper",
amount: 94.12,
date: new Date(2020, 7, 14),
}

<ExpenseItem
title={expenses[0].title}
amount={expenses[0].amount}
date={expenses[0].date}
/>

<!-- ExpenseItem.js -->

function ExpenseItem(props) {
const expenseDate = props.date;
const expenseTitle = props.title;
const expenseAmount = props.amount;

return (

<div className="expense-item">
<div>{expenseDate.toISOString()}</div>
<div className="expense-item__description">
<h2>{expenseTitle}</h2>
<div className="expense-item__price">${expenseAmount}</div>
</div>
</div>
);
}

# Splitting Components Into Multiple Components

When we need to split a component, create a new js file. Ex - ExpenseDate.js

Then copy the code needed to split, put the code on the new file and export.

Import the file where needed.

<!-- ExpenseDate.js -->

function ExpenseDate(props) {
const month = props.date.toLocaleString("en-US", { month: "long" });
const day = props.date.toLocaleString("en-US", { day: "2-digit" });
const year = props.date.getFullYear();

return (

<div className="expense-date">
<div className="expense-date__month">{month}</div>
<div className="expense-date__year">{year}</div>
<div className="expense-date__day">{day}</div>
</div>
);
}

<!-- ExpenseItem.js -->
<div className="expense-item">
    <ExpenseDate date={props.date} />
    <div className="expense-item__description">
    <h2>{expenseTitle}</h2>
    <div className="expense-item__price">${expenseAmount}</div>
    </div>
</div>

# The concept of "Composition" (children props)

Composition - multiple component used to bulding a user interface from smaller building blocks is called composition

1. Create e custom component
2. Use {props.children}
3. Use js logic to add existing className

Ex - Check out Card.js({props.children}, CSS). ExpenseItem.js, Expense.js

# Organizing Component Files

Create sub folder in components based on work.

1. Expenses
2. UI

# Listen to event & Working with event Handlers

Naming Convension, add Handler beforeEnd :p
add event listner as attribute.
Ex -
const clickhandler = () => console.log("clicked");
<button onClick={clickhandler}>Change Name</button>

# Working with "State"

1. Import useState
2. create constant. Ex - const[title, setTitle] = useState(props.title)
3. Conduct an event and use setTitle()

ExpenseItem.js For more details

# How can you change what a component displays on the screen?

Create some "state" value (via useState) which you can then change and output in JSX.

For example search previous state in react doc - https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html

IMPORTANT NOTE - If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a function to setState. The function will receive the previous value, and return an updated value. Hereâ€™s an example of a counter component that uses both forms of setState:

const [state, setState] = useState({});
setState(prevState => {
// Object.assign would also work
return {...prevState, ...updatedValues};
});

# Listening to User Input

# Working with multiple States

^ Check React Docs, ExpenseForm.js for reference

Declaring state variables as a pair of [something, setSomething] is also handy because it lets us give different names to different state variables if we want to use more than one:

function ExampleWithManyStates() {
// Declare multiple state variables!
const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);

# Multiple Value Using One State Instead (And What's Better) - Opposite of multiple states

By calling useState() only one and then by passing in an object as a value, not a string or number but an object.You can now group together, your three states. Ex -

const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState({
enteredTitle: '',
enteredAmount: '',
enteredDate: '',
})

# Updating State That Depends On The Previous State

State could be chnaged in many way, Right now the way is replacing previous state with new state. Ex - replacing above state

const titleChangeHandler = (event) => {
setUserInput({ ...userInput, enteredTitle: event.target.value });
setUserInput((prevState) => {
return { ...prevState, enteredTitle: event.target.value };
});
};

# Handling form submission

Form submission method should use a function. This function should use data from new state. Ex -

const submitHandler = (event) => {
event.preventDefault();
console.log(
userInput.enteredTitle,
userInput.enteredAmount,
userInput.enteredDate
);
};

# Adding Two-Way Binding

For input we dont just listen them but also pass new value into the input. So we can reset or change input programmatically. All we have to do is add value={} default attribute in the elements

# Child-to-parent Component Comunication

To comunicate child to parent, you should add a new prop on parent element, Naming convension - start with 'on'.

1. create a props in parent element. But dont call it here. Ex -
   <ExpenseForm onSaveExpenseData={saveExpenseDataHandler} />

2. Create a function for handler -
   const saveExpenseDataHandler = (enteredExpenseData) => {
   console.log(enteredExpenseData);
   };

3. Add props to child component. Ex -
   const ExpenseForm = (props)

4. call the handler in child to pass data to parent -
   props.onSaveExpenseData(userInput);

# Lifting The State Up
